      <p>I am a business analyst with hands-on operations, finance, and legal experience coupled with skills in Excel, VBA, Python, and SQL from Northwesternâ€™s data science bootcamp. Innate intellectual curiosity drives continual growth and a quick understanding of how individual pieces fit within the bigger picture. During my career, I have demonstrated entrepreneurial spirit through founding and development of a start-up Montessori school that grew to 330 children with 85 employees. My unique experience as an entrepreneur provides me with valuable insight into what it takes to grow a business and a well honed ability to problem solve swiftly and efficiently at both the macro and micro level. This and several other projects have helped me to expand my understanding of the tools available to data analysts. I am seeking opportunities in an organization where I can further develop my technical skills to contribute to organizational growth and in the long term bring to bear my backgrounds in business start-up, finance, and law.</p>
